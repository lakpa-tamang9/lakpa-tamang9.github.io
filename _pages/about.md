I am a first year PhD Student at Deakin University, Geelong, Australia. Currently I am associated with [Machine Learning Decision Group](https://deakin-mlds.github.io/index.html) where I am working as a Research Assistant co-supervised by Dr. [Mohammed Reda](https://rbouadjenek.github.io/), Dr. [Sunil Aryal](https://sunilaryal.github.io/), and Prof. Dr. [Richard Dazeley](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/richard-dazeley). My primary research interests include making the Machine Learning models reliable under various types of data distribution shifts. I completed my Master's Degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Changwon National University, South Korea in July 2021. I was Graduate Research Assistant in [Information and Intelligent Systems Lab](https://acsl.creatorlink.net/index#), led by Asst. Prof [Byung Wook Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S9lA_PsAAAAJ&hl=ko). Prior to joining PhD, I worked as an AI Research Engineer (2021-2023) at [Intelligence Design Co.](https://www.intelligencedesign.co.kr/?page_id=78).
